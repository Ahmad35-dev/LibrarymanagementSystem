# 📚 Library Management System

Library Management System is a full-stack web application built using Java EE technologies. It uses **Java Servlets**, **JSP**, and **JDBC** on the backend, connected to a **MySQL** database. The frontend is developed with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to provide a responsive and interactive user experience. Users can perform operations such as adding, updating, viewing, and deleting book records. The project follows the **MVC architecture** to separate concerns and improve code maintainability. This system demonstrates how to integrate frontend and backend technologies to build a real-world Java web application.
